![Design for the FreeCodeCamp](/Assets/Images/screenshot.png)

## WELCOME! ðŸ‘‹

This is a challenge proposed by the website **[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)**,  that is a non-profit organization consisting of an interactive web learning platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, Medium publications and local organizations that aim to make web development learning accessible to anyone.

## The Challenge ðŸŽ¯

This challenge is to reproduce this **[Survey Form](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP)** as close as possible to the original design.

This challenge is very simple, it has no back-end and also no JS to validate the fields. I used this challenge to train my skills with responsive websites, styling and using multiple inputs on the same page

## Technologies Used ðŸ§©

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Responsive Website
