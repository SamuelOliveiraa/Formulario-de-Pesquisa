# FreeCodeCamp - Survey Form

![Design for the FreeCodeCamp](/Assets/Images/screenshot.png)

## WELCOME! ðŸ‘‹

This is a challenge proposed by the website **[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)**,  that is a non-profit organization consisting of an interactive web learning platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, Medium publications and local organizations that aim to make web development learning accessible to anyone.

## The Challenge ðŸŽ¯

This challenge is to reproduce this **Survey Form** as close as possible to the original design.

My biggest difficulties in this project were implementing the Email validation with Js, but after a lot of research and dedication I realized that it wasn't that difficult. I still have a bit of difficulty using JS, but with time I get the hang of it.

## Technologies Used ðŸ§©

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JAVASCRIPT
* Media-queries
